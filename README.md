## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS custom properties** (variables for colors, radius, shadows, font size)  
- **CSS Grid** for the card layout  
- **Flexbox** for centering content  
- **Clamp()** for fluid responsive typography  
- **Google Fonts** (Poppins)  
- **Mobile-first workflow** with a single desktop media query  
- Subtle **hover transition** for interactivity  

### What I learned

- This project helped me practice modern responsive techniques
- getting more comfortable using `clamp()` for scalable font sizes:
- Leveraging CSS Grid auto-placement so that cards naturally flow into rows/columns without extra grid positioning.

## Continued development 
Excited to learn more and keep doing projects
